# Real-Engine
Real Engine is a cross-platform, general-purpose game engine built in C++, designed for both 2D and 3D games. It combines the performance and flexibility of low-level APIs like SDL2 and OpenGL, with a modern, modular architecture that scales from indie projects to more ambitious titles.
